Refactored the last five cards in the cardEffect function, treasure map, sea hag, salvager, outpost, and embargo. Chose these five simply because it would be easiest to 
scroll back and forth from the end of cardEffect and the new functions I was creating below cardEffect. 
 
First, I created placeholders for all of my new functions before cardEffect was called, then their declarations below the end of the file.
I had to examine the variables each card needed, and include their being passed in the declaration of my new functions, but that was fairly simple. 
All of these new functions return to one variable, which I named result. After calling each function, and putting their return value in result, I return result. 
With these preparations, I was able to copy the code in each case statement into their new separate functions, and the program compiled. I also added a few bugs 
to each of the functions, and made sure it compiled again.
