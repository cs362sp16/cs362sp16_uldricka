Bug found in your smithy card, using my unit test for the card function. 
My unit test output: "Smithy did not correctly add three cards to hand"
Upon closer examination, I think the error lies in the lack of brackets following the for loop on line 1324. 

Lines currently are: 
for(i=0; i<3; i++)
drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

Fixed by: 
for(i=0; i<3; i++){
drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
}
