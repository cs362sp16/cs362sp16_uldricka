Bug found in your village card, using my unit test for that specific card. 
My unit test output: "village card did not increment two actions"

Bug was fairly easy to find, you decremented two instead of incrementing two actions on line 667. 

Line is: 
	state->numActions = state->numActions - 2;

Should be: 
		state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;
